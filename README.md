# Projector T-Shirt Machine ðŸŽ¨ðŸ‘•

This is my project that won 2nd place prize at Durhack. Projector T-Shirt Machine turns your own body into a wearable canvas. It using open cv and mediapipe for detecting hand gestures that allows you to paint your design on a virtual board, save it, and then project it directly onto yourself, all while maintaining dynamic scaling as you move closer or further from the projector.

### How It Works

1. **The Start Screen (start.py)**: 

   When ruuning the project, run `start.py`, which will display an abstract looking canvas of a start screen created using Pygame. The canvas start screen features splashes of paint in random spaces of the screen in various colours and a bunch of lines/walls inspired by Kandinsky Jaune Rounge Bleu painting. A projector is drawn using squares and circles with the title wriitn on top.The mouse acts as a dynamic light source casting rays using Bresenham's line algorithm to create a sun light effect and the start button takes you to the projector t-shirt machine.
   
2. **Hand Tracking(handTracking.py)**:
   The `handTracking.py` is used to capture your hand movements in real-time, using MediaPipe and OpenCV landmark detection to find the x and y coordinates for each finger joint through processing every frame. The getPosition method gets the 2D-pixel coordinates of each finger joint and the getUpFingers returns a list of booleans that indicate which fingers are raised based on the relative position of the joints to determine gestures such as fingers raised. This is used to turn your hands into a paintbrush and for navigation.

   
3. **Virtual Canvas and Overlay (project.py)**:
   When you launch project.py through start.py, your webcam opens and displays an array of buttons on your camera window. These buttons allow you to select colours, change brush size, clear the canvas, toggle the drawing board, and save your creation. Buttons can be selected by raising a finger, with handTracker.py tracking your finger movements on the window.

   When you select the board button by raising your finger, the visibility of the board is toggled. The button, controlled by boardBtn, switches between "Board" and "Hide." When the board is visible, whiteBoard.drawReact(frame) renders it over the main frame, allowing you to draw on it.

   Raising your finger to select the colour palette button opens a colour menu, including an Eraser and Clear option. The menu, controlled by colorsBtn, toggles between "Colours" and "Hide" based on whether itâ€™s open or hidden. When the index finger is extended (raised) and no other fingers are up, upFingers from handTracker.py detects this and activates a drawing mode. In drawing mode, cv2.line draws a line from the previous finger position (px, py), creating a continuous drawing effect as you move your finger. The RGB and alpha values adjust based on the selected colour. Selecting the Eraser sets the colour to black, which effectively removes parts of the drawing rather than adding to it.

   To change the brush size, penBtn displays available pen sizes, and selecting one updates brushSize. To indicate which colour or brush size is selected, the buttonâ€™s transparency (alpha) is adjusted, making it clear what has been clicked.

   When you click saveBtn, the current drawing is saved as an image, board_drawing.png, in the [`tshirtsdesigns folder`](./tshirtsdesigns), with a transparent background applied using add_transparency. A copy of the image is also saved in the [`gallery folder`](./tshirtsdesigns/gallery), allowing it to be overlaid on the chest in other applications.
